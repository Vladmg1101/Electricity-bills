# Electricity-bills
It is desired to implement a system that keeps track of electricity bills on more months. Invoices are issued monthly and their record is kept starting with a date read from the keyboard. The values invoices are read from the keyboard until they meet EOF (End-of-file).
The following data is read from the keyboard:
● an integer representing the starting year;
● an integer representing the starting month;
● an integer representing an order(between 1 and 4);
● an integer for each invoice representing the value of the invoice, until the EOF meeting.
For the first order(command == 1): The invoice values will be displayed on the screen, in the order of reading from the keyboard, one value at a time
separate row.
For the second order(command == 2): The year and month will be displayed together with the corresponding invoice.
For the third order(command == 3): All existing invoices from the starting year will be displayed on the screen
keeping track of invoices.
For the last order(command == 4): The year in which the maximum value between the months was recorded will be displayed on the screen
equal to the month from which the keeping of invoices started.
